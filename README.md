# The Coffee House

The Coffee House is a IRC client that intends to be quick and easy to use, while being online. **"This sounds a lot like IRCCloud!"**, I hear you say. Well, while this does sound a lot like IRCCloud we intend to make an online client that enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts can really dig. Here's some features we have in mind for The Coffee House:
 - Module Support
